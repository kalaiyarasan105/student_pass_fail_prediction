# 📊 Student Performance Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project was completed as part of my **AI & ML Internship (Week 2)** with **NSP NEXUS**.

## 🔍 Objective
To build a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on:
- 📚 Hours Studied
- 📈 Attendance Percentage

## 📁 Dataset
A manually created dataset with the following structure:

| Hours_Studied | Attendance (%) | Pass/Fail |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| 5             | 85             | 1         |
| 2             | 60             | 0         |
| ...           | ...            | ...       |

- **1 = Pass**, **0 = Fail**

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Steps Implemented
1. Created a small dataset manually.
2. Visualized the data using scatter plot.
3. Split the data into training and test sets.
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluated the model accuracy.
6. Made predictions on new input values.

## ✅ Sample Prediction
Example input:
- Hours Studied = 3
- Attendance = 70%

👉 Output: `Pass` or `Fail`
